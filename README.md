# Modeling a Communication Channel under Jamming - Theory and Applications

The data acquired from the wireless communication channel during our experimental campaign have been also released open-source, to allow researchers and Industry to verify our findings, and to further validate the effectiveness of their methods on real outdoor channel conditions.

We conducted a large experimental campaign, by acquiring real jamming signals outdoor for more than $XXX$~hours, on three different reference channels (500.00MHz, 1,575.42MHz, and 2,437.00MHz), and we analyzed the resulting status of the channel at increasing distance from the jamming source.
